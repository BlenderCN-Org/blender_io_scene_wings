This is the first revision of a Wings3d Importer for blender 2.5
Currently the following features are supported/need testing

*- Basic Geometry
*- Ngons (currently these are broken up to tri's on import - either wait for bmesh or figure out fgons)
*- vertex colors
*- uv coords
*- hard edges
*- virtual mirror (currently assumes mirror is on x-axis will need to do something clever to get more)
*- opengl material properties
*- multiple materials per face

The following are not implemented yet

*- external textures - this is the next thing on the list
*- internal textures - doesn't seem possible with the current python api
*- cameras
*- lights
*- folders
*- export
