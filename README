This is a plugin for blender
currently to install you will need to copy this folder to the blender addons folder eg blender-2.57b/2.57/scripts/addons/
you will then need to enable the addon in file->user preferences


The following works

*- geometry including ngons
*- vertex colors
*- uv coords
*- hard edges *
*- virtual mirror **
*- opengl material properties
*- multiple materials per face
*- external textures
*- lights ***

The following are not implemented yet

*- cameras ****
*- internal textures *****
*- folders/hidden/editable/etc
*- holes
*- export
*- ui options

notes
*       to test this meshes have a subdision modifier attached to them by default

**      currently only shows correctly if virtual mirror was on x axis... I have plans to make this work for
        any orrientation but i haven't implented them yet

***     to match the behaviour of lights in wings3d lights have a TrackTo constraint that points at the
        light towards a dummy positioned at the wings aim point.

****    cameras will import but are not positioned correctly yet...

*****   there doesn't seem to be any way to create images from memory chunks in current blender pyhton api
        will require either an api update or a workaround of writing image to disk first
