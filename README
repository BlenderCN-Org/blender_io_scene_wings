This is a plugin for blender 
currently to install you will need to copy this folder to the blender addons folder eg blender-2.57b/2.57/scripts/addons/
you will then need to enable the addon in file->user preferences


The following works

*- Basic Geometry
*- Ngons *
*- vertex colors
*- uv coords **
*- hard edges
*- virtual mirror ***
*- opengl material properties
*- multiple materials per face
*- external textures 

The following are not implemented yet

*- internal textures - doesn't seem possible with the current python api- I could be dodgy and create an image texture
*- cameras
*- lights
*- folders/hidden/editable/etc
*- holes
*- export

currently the following are known issues: -
* ngons are converted to tris - long term it would be good to convert these to fgons (or wait for bmesh)
** uv coords are currently rotated 90 degrees on each individual face
*** virtual mirror currently only works on x axis - will need to calculate normal on the mirror face
